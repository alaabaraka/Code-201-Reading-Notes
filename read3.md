HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow
Lists
There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types.

Types of Lists
1- Ordered lists. 2- Unordered lists. 3- Definition lists.

chapter 13 “Boxes” :
every box has a width and height proparties, by default the size of box just big enough to hold its contents.
to determine the size of box you can use:
pixels(px)pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
persentage (%) the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window.
ems the size of the box is based on the size of text within it.
you can limiting width by using min-width specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the rowser window is narrow, max-width indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide. and the same thing with min-height,max-height .

Overflowing Content: The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
hidden This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
scroll This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
Border: The border separates the edge of one box from another, they have a severl values to border-width : thin,meduim,thick or write the width in numbers in pixel , you can controlling the width of each side border-top-width: vlaue and the same thing with other sides .border-style to control the style (solid,dotted,…) , and border-colorto determine the color. also you can write all of them in one line by border : width style colorfor example border: 2px solid black .
Margin : the distance between the border and other box betwwen , you can controled the marign-top , margin-left , .. the same thing to other sides.( If you want to center a box on the page you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.)
Padding : the distance between the content and the border,you can controled the padding-top ,.. to other sides.

all of margin ,border, padding will adding to the size of box.

displye values : inline , block , inline-block , none.

visibility :The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been.
hidden :This hides the element.
visible :This shows the element.
box-shadow The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.
Horizontal offset :Negative values position the shadow to the left of the box.
Vertical offset:Negative values position the shadow to the top of the box.
Blur distance:If omitted, the shadow is a solidline like a border.
Spread of shadow :If used, a positive value will cause the shadow to expand in all directions, and negative value will make it contract.
border-radius The value indicates the size of the radius in pixels. You can specify individual values for each corner of a box using border-top-right-radius,border-bottom-right-radius,border-bottom-left-radius,border-top-left-radius.
To create more complex shapes, you can specify different distances for the horizontal and the vertical parts of the rounded corners for example border-radius: 80px 50px;
Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional (Links to an external site.) structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
A typical script in JavaScript (Links to an external site.) or PHP (Links to an external site.) (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops (Links to an external site.) and functions (Links to an external site.). Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events (Links to an external site.)occur.

For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the Submitbutton for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the if and else sections, the lines promptUser and submitForm could also be calls to other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
